All the documentation is located in the doc/ subdir.

FreeMiNT development has been community-driven without a dedicated maintainer since 2016. Contributors for all subsystems are welcome, be it for bugfixing, adding new features, improving documentation or testing.

Please note that if your file system doesn't support long filenames some of the files could have unpacked with truncated names.
